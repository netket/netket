    "# Using JAX as a backend in NetKet - Feature Preview for v3.0 \n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial we will show how differentiable functions (for example deep networks) written in [JAX](https://github.com/google/jax) can be used as variational quantum states in NetKet. \n",
    "\n",
    "This feature will be available in the upcoming major release (version 3.0). While version 3.0 is still in beta development, users can already try this feature. \n",
    "\n",

    "## Prerequisites \n",
    "\n",
    "To try out integration with JAX, you first need to fetch the development version of NetKet (v3.0) \n",

    "pip install git+https://github.com/netket/netket@v3.0\n",

    "Frameworks such as JAX and Pytorch are add-ons for NetKet 3.0, thus they require separate installation. In this case, we can easily get JAX doing \n",

    "## Defining the quantum system \n",

    "NetKet allows for full flexibility in defining quantum systems, for example when tackling a ground-state search problem. While there are a few pre-defined hamiltonians, it is relatively straightforward to implement new quantum operators/ Hamiltonians. \n",
