		Optax version {version} (< 0.1.1) is too old and incompatible with NetKet. 
		Please update `optax` by running the command:

			pip install --upgrade pip
			pip install --upgrade netket optax
		
		(assuming you are using pip. Similar commands can be used on conda).

		This error most likely happened because you either have an old version of `pip`
		or you are hard-coding the `optax` version in a requirements file.

		Reason: Optax is NetKet's provider of optimisers. Versions before 0.1.1 did not
		support complex numbers and silently returned wrong values, especially when
		using optimisers involving the norm of the gradient such as `Adam`. 
		As recent versions of optax correctly work with complex numbers, please upgrade.
