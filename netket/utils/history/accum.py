    Accumulate history data in nested tree structures.
    
    This function is designed to build complex nested history structures incrementally
    by accumulating data from dictionaries with potentially different keys at each 
    iteration. It's particularly useful for logging systems where different metrics
    are computed at different frequencies.
    
    Args:
        tree_accum: The accumulated tree structure containing History objects.
            Can be None or empty for the first call.
        tree: The new data to accumulate, typically a nested dictionary.
        **kwargs: Additional keyword arguments, commonly including 'step' to
            specify the iteration number.
    
    Returns:
        An updated tree structure where each leaf contains a History object
        with the accumulated time-series data.
    
    Examples:

        .. code-block:: python
        
            from netket.utils import history

            data = {
                'energy': -1.5,
                'variance': 0.3
            }
            data_log = history.accum_histories_in_tree(data_log, data, step=0)
            
            # Second iteration: log basic metrics + additional diagnostics
            data = {
                'energy': -1.8,
                'variance': 0.25,
                'diagnostics': {
                    'acceptance_rate': 0.7,
                    'step_size': 0.01
                }
            }
            data_log = history.accum_histories_in_tree(data_log, data, step=1)
            
            # Third iteration: only basic metrics (diagnostics skipped)
            data = {
                'energy': -2.1,
                'variance': 0.18
            }
            data_log = history.accum_histories_in_tree(data_log, data, step=2)
            
            # Access the accumulated histories
            print(f"Energy history: {data_log['energy']}")
            print(f"Diagnostics logged at: {data_log['diagnostics/acceptance_rate'].iters}")
        
        This shows how different metrics can be logged at independent iterations,
        with the function automatically handling the creation and accumulation of
        History objects for each data path.
