"""NetKet error classes.
(Inspired by NetKet error classes)

=== When to create a NetKet error class?

If an error message requires more explanation than a one-liner, it is useful to
add it as a separate error class. This may lead to some duplication with
existing documentation or docstrings, but it will provide users with more help
when they are debugging a problem. We can also point to existing documentation
from the error docstring directly.

=== How to name the error class?

* If the error occurs when doing something, name the error
  <Verb><Object><TypeOfError>Error

  For instance, if you want to raise an error when applying a module with an
  invalid method, the error can be: ApplyModuleInvalidMethodError.

 <TypeOfError> is optional, for instance if there is only one error when
  modifying a variable, the error can simply be: ModifyVariableError.

* If there is no concrete action involved the only a description of the error is
  sufficient. For instance: InvalidFilterError, NameInUseError, etc.


=== Copy/pastable template for new error messages:

  "" "

class NumbaOperatorGetConnDuringTracingError(NetketError):
    """Illegal attempt to use Numba-operators inside of a Jax
    function transformation.

    This happens when calling :meth:`~netket.operator.DiscreteOperator.get_conn_padded` or
    :meth:`~netket.operator.DiscreteOperator.get_conn_flattened` inside of a function
    that is being transformed by jax with transformations such as :func:`jax.jit`
    or :func:`jax.grad`, and the operator is not compatible with Jax.

    To avoid this error you can (i) convert your operator to a Jax compatible format if possible,
    or (ii) compute the connected elements outside of the jax function transformation and pass the
    results to a jax-transformed function.

    (i) Converting an Operator to a Jax compatible format
    -----------------------------------------------------

    Some operators can be converted to a jax-compatible format by calling the method
    `operator.to_jax_operator()`. If this method is not available or raises an error, it means
    that the operator cannot be converted.

    If the operator can be converted to a jax-compatible format, it will be possible to pass
    it as a standard argument to a jax-transformed function and it should not be declared as
    a static argument.

    Jax compatible operators can be used like standard operators, for example by passing
    it to :meth:`~netket.vqs.MCState.expect` function. However, the performance will differ from
    standard operators. In general, you might find that compile time will be much worse, while
    runtime might be faster or slower, depending on several factors.

    The biggest advantage to Jax operators, however, is when experimenting with jax code, as you
    can succesfully use them in your own custom functions as in the example below:

    .. code-block:: python

        import netket as nk
        import jax
        import jax.numpy as jnp

        graph = nk.graph.Chain(10)
        hilbert = nk.hilbert.Spin(1/2, graph.n_nodes)
        ham = nk.operator.Ising(hilbert, graph, h=1.0)
        ham_jax = ham.to_jax_operator()

        ma = nk.models.RBM()
        pars = ma.init(jax.random.PRNGKey(1), jnp.ones((2,graph.n_nodes)))

        samples = hilbert.all_states()

        @jax.jit
        def compute_local_energies(pars, ham_jax, s):
            # this would raise the error
            sp, mels = ham.get_conn_padded(s)
            # this will work
            sp, mels = ham_jax.get_conn_padded(s)

            logpsi_sp = ma.apply(pars, sp)
            logpsi_s = jnp.expand_dims(ma.apply(pars, s), -1)

            return jnp.sum(mels * jnp.exp(logpsi_sp-logpsi_s), axis=-1)

        elocs = compute_local_energies(pars, ham_jax, samples)
        elocs_grad = jax.jacrev(compute_local_energies)(pars, ham_jax, samples)

    .. note::

        Note that this transformation might be a relatively expensive operation, so you should avoid
        executing this inside of an hot loop.


    (ii) Precomputing connected elements outside of Jax transformations
    -------------------------------------------------------------------

    In most cases you won't be able to convert the operator to a Jax-compatible format.
    In those cases, the workaround we usually employ is to precompute the connected elements
    before entering the Jax context, splitting our function into a non-jitted function and
    into a jitted kernel.

    .. code-block:: python

      import netket as nk
      import jax
      import jax.numpy as jnp

      graph = nk.graph.Chain(10)
      hilbert = nk.hilbert.Spin(1/2, graph.n_nodes)
      ham = nk.operator.Ising(hilbert, graph, h=1.0)

      ma = nk.models.RBM()
      pars = ma.init(jax.random.PRNGKey(1), jnp.ones((2,graph.n_nodes)))

      samples = hilbert.all_states()

      def compute_local_energies(pars, ham, s):
          sp, mels = ham.get_conn_padded(s)
          return _compute_local_energies_kernel(pars, s, sp, mels)

      @jax.jit
      def _compute_local_energies_kernel(pars, s, sp, mels):
          logpsi_sp = ma.apply(pars, sp)
          logpsi_s = jnp.expand_dims(ma.apply(pars, s), -1)
          return jnp.sum(mels * jnp.exp(logpsi_sp-logpsi_s), axis=-1)

      elocs = compute_local_energies(pars, ham_jax, samples)
      elocs_grad = jax.jacrev(compute_local_energies)(pars, ham_jax, samples)


    Most :class:`~netket.operator.DiscreteOperator`s are implemented in Numba and therefore are not jax-compatible.
    To know if it's valid to use an operator inside of a jax function transformation you can
    check that it inherits from :class:`~netket.operator.DiscreteJaxOperator` by executing

    Notice that :class:`~netket.operator.DiscreteJaxOperator` can be used inside of jax

    .. note::

        This limitation is not systematic, and it could be lifted in the future by some
        interested coder. If at that moment Jax will support dynamic shape, this feature could
        be implemented at no additional runtime cost. If Jax won't support yet dynamic shapes
        then it should be implemented as a secondary path (instead of this error) that is only
        taken if the operator is constructed inside of a jax context. This path will lead to a
        slightly less optimized, higher computational cost operators.

        If you are really interested in contributing to NetKet and find yourself in need of
        building operators in a jax context (for example because you're doing optimal control),

        when needed. To check whether an operator was initialized you can probe the boolean flag
        :code:`operator._initialized`. If :code:`operator._initialized` is True, you can safely call
        :meth:`~netket.operator.DiscreteJaxOperator.get_conn_padded` and similar methods. If it is
        False, then the setup procedure will be handled by an internal method usually called
        :code:`operator._setup()`. If you see this error, it means that this method internally
        uses dynamically determined shapes, and it is what should be converted to be jax-friendly.

    to prevent the common mistake of assuming that the QGT is complex we
    explicitly raise this error, forcing users to manually multiply the QGT
    by the real and imaginary part of the vector, as we would have to do
    inside of this class anyway.

    If this is really the mathematical operation you want to perform, then
    you can do it manually, but very often we have found that when you
    apply the real part of the QGT to a complex vector you might have
    your math wrong. In such cases, sometimes what you actually wanted
    to do was

    .. code:: python

       >>> import netket as nk; import jax
       >>>
       >>> vstate = nk.vqs.FullSumState(nk.hilbert.Spin(0.5, 5), \
                                        nk.models.RBM(param_dtype=complex))
       >>> _, vec = vstate.expect_and_grad(nk.operator.spin.sigmax(vstate.hilbert, 1))
       >>> G = nk.optimizer.qgt.QGTOnTheFly(vstate, holomorphic=False)
       >>>
       >>> vec_real = jax.tree.map(lambda x: x.real, vec)
       >>> sol = G@vec_real

   Or, if you used the QGT in a linear solver, try using:

   .. code:: python

       >>> import netket as nk; import jax
       >>>
       >>> vstate = nk.vqs.FullSumState(nk.hilbert.Spin(0.5, 5), \
                                        nk.models.RBM(param_dtype=complex))

       >>>
       >>> G = nk.optimizer.qgt.QGTOnTheFly(vstate, holomorphic=False)

    Warning thrown when calling `random_state` on a Hilbert space with a custom constraint.

    This warning is thrown when the custom Hilbert space constraint does not have a custom
    `random_state` method implemented. This will default to a slow, possibly infinitely-looping
    method to generate random states.

    The default fallback works by generating random states in the unconstrained Hilbert space
    until one is found that satisfies the constraint. This can be very slow, and even never
    terminate if the constraint is too restrictive.

    .. note::

        Generating random states is only required when initializing a Markov Chain Monte Carlo
        sampler, but is generally not needed during on. Therefore, even if this warning is thrown,
        it might not be a problem if you do not reset your chains very often.

        In general, if your constraint is not overly (exponentially) restrictive, you may not
        need to worry about this warning.

    .. note::

        The fallback implementation is not optimised, especially on GPUs. It will generate 1 random
        state at a time until it finds one that satisfies the constraint, and will repeat this for
        every different chain.

    This error is thrown to prevent you from accidentally creating a new attribute that is not
    part of the Pytree structure, which would lead to unexpected behaviour.

    Note that if the field is not a jax-Array or another Pytree, you should instead declare it as a static
    or non-node field, which will trigger recompilation when passed to jax functions, as shown below:

    .. code-block:: python

    The old behaviour is the default behaviour of NetKet 3.14 and before, while the new
    behaviour will become the default starting 1st january 2025.
    For that reason, in the transition period, we will print warnings asking to explicitly
    specify which ordering you want

    .. warning::

        The ordering of the Spin Hilbert space basis has historically always been
        such that `-1=↑, 1=↓`, but it will be changed 1st january 2025 to
        be such that `1=↑, -1=↓`.

        The change will break:
            - code that relies on the assumption that -1=↑;
            - all saves because the inputs to the network will change;
            - custom operators that rely on the basis being ordered;

        To avoid distruption, NetKet will support **both** conventions in the (near)
        future. You can specify the ordering you need with :code:`inverted_ordering = True`
        (historical ordering) or :code:`inverted_ordering=False` (future default behaviour).

        If you do not specify this flag, a future version of NetKet might break your
        serialized weights or other logic, so we strongly reccomend that you either
        limit yourself to NetKet 3.14, or that you specify :code:`inverted_ordering`
        explicitly.

    To avoid this warning, you can :

     - explicitly specify the ordering you want wit the `inverted_ordering` flag, which will
       ensure that your code will still work in the future with no changes. If possible,
       we suggest you use the new ordering `inverted_ordering=False`, but if you want to
       keep loading parameters serialized before th switch, you should use `inverted_ordering=True`.

     - You can silence this warning by setting the environment variable
       ``NETKET_SPIN_ORDERING_WARNING=0`` or by setting
       ``nk.config.netket_spin_ordering_warning = False`` in your code.

                - To maintain the current behaviour in the future, specify `inverted_ordering=True` (this
                    allows you to load NN parameters you have saved in the past)
                - To opt-in today in the future default, specify `inverted_ordering=False` (so your code will
                    work without changes in the future)
