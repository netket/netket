    """
    Semi-lazy representation of an S Matrix where the Jacobian O_k is precomputed
    and stored as a PyTree.

    The matrix of gradients O is computed on initialisation, but not S,
    which can be computed by calling :code:`to_dense`.
    The details on how the ⟨S⟩⁻¹⟨F⟩ system is solved are contained in
    the field `sr`.

    Numerical estimates of the QGT are usually ill-conditioned and require
    regularisation. The standard approach is to add a positive constant to the diagonal;
    alternatively, Becca and Sorella (2017) propose scaling this offset with the
    diagonal entry itself. NetKet allows using both in tandem:

    .. math::

        S_{ii} \\mapsto S_{ii} + \\epsilon_1 S_{ii} + \\epsilon_2;

    :math:`\\epsilon_{1,2}` are specified using `diag_scale` and `diag_shift`,
    respectively.

    Args:
        vstate: The variational state
        mode: "real", "complex" or "holomorphic": specifies the implementation
              used to compute the jacobian. "real" discards the imaginary part
              of the output of the model. "complex" splits the real and imaginary
              part of the parameters and output. It works also for non holomorphic
              models. holomorphic works for any function assuming it's holomorphic
              or real valued.
        holomorphic: a flag to indicate that the function is holomorphic.
        diag_scale: Fractional shift :math:`\\epsilon_1` added to diagonal entries (see above).
        diag_shift: Constant shift :math:`\\epsilon_2` added to diagonal entries (see above).
        chunk_size: If supplied, overrides the chunk size of the variational state
                    (useful for models where the backward pass requires more
                    memory than the forward pass).
