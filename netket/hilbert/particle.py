        Constructs new ``Particles`` given specifications
        of the continuous space they are defined in.

        Args:
            N: Number of particles. If int all have the same spin. If Tuple the entry indicates how many particles
                there are with a certain spin-projection.
            L: Tuple indicating the maximum of the continuous quantum number(s) in the configurations. Each entry
                in the tuple corresponds to a different physical dimension.
                If `np.inf` is used an infinite box is considered and `pbc=False` is mandatory (because what are PBC
                if there are no boundaries?). If a finite value is given, a minimum value of zero is assumed for the
                quantum number(s).
                A particle in a 3D box of size L would take `(L,L,L)`. A rotor model would take e.g. `(2pi,)`.
            pbc: Tuple or bool indicating whether to use periodic boundary conditions in a given physical dimension.
                If tuple it must have the same length as domain. If bool the same value is used for all the dimensions
                defined in domain.
            D: (Optional) Number of dimensions. Can be specified instead of `L` and `pbc` in order to construct a
                `Particle` in a $D-$ dimensional infinite box. Equivalent to
