This module constains functions that act on hilbert spaces necessary
for sampling.

If you define custom hilbert spaces, and want to sample from it, you
should read carefully.

This module *exports* two functions:
 - `random_state(hilbert, key, batch_size, dtype)` which generates a batch of random
 states in the given hilbert space, in an array with the specified dtype.
 - `flip_state(hilb, key, states, indices)` which, for every state σ in the batch of
 states, considers σᵢ and returns a new state where that entry is different from the
 previous. The new configuration is selected with uniform probability among the local
 possible configurations.

Hilbert spaces must at least implement a `random_state` to support sampling.
`flip_state` is only necessary in order to use LocalRule samplers.
All hilbert spaces in netket implement both.

How to implement the two functions above
----------------------------------------

While the *exported* function acts on batches, sometimes it is hard to implement
the function on batches. Therefore they can be implemented either as a scalar
function, that gets jax.vmap-ed automatically, or directly as a batched rule.
Of course, if you implement the batched rule you will most likely see better
performance.

In order to implement the scalar rule for your custom hilbert object `MyHilbert`
you should define a function taking 4 inputs, the hilbert space, a jax PRNG key and
the dtype of the derised result. For random operations you should use the key
provided.

@netket.utils.dispatch.dispatch
def random_state(hilb: MyHilbert, key, dtype):
    return mystate

@netket.utils.dispatch.dispatch
def random_state(hilb: MyHilbert, key, batches: int, dtype):
    return mystate

flip_state is implemented in the same way, through

@netket.utils.dispatch.dispatch
def flip_state_scalar(hilb: Fock, key, σ, idx):
    return new_state, oldval

There is a vmapped default fallback for the batched version.

@netket.utils.dispatch.dispatch
def flip_state_batch(hilb: Fock, key, σ, idx):
    return new_states, oldvals
