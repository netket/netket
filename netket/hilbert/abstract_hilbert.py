    This class defines the common interface used to interact with Hilbert spaces.

    An AbstractHilbert object identifies an Hilbert space and a computational basis on
    such hilbert space, such as the z-basis for spins on a lattice, or the
    position-basis for particles in a box.

    Hilbert Spaces are generally immutable python objects that must be hashable in order
    to be used as static arguments to `jax.jit` functions.
