class DiscreteHilbertConstraint(struct.Pytree):
    r"""
    Protocol to define an Abstract Constraint for a discete Hilbert space.

    To define a customized constraint, you must subclass this class and at least implement the
    :code:`__call__` method. The :code:`__call__` method should take as input a matrix encoding a batch of
    configurations, and return a vector of booleans specifying whether they are valid configurations
    or not.

    The :code:`__call__` method must be :code:`jax.jit`-able. If you cannot make it jax-jittable, you can implement
    it in numba/python and wrap it into a :func:`jax.pure_callback` to make it compatible with jax.

    The callback should be hashable and comparable with itself, which means it must implement :code:`__hash__` and :code:`__eq__`.
    By default, the :code:`__hash__` method is implemented by the `id` of the object, which is unique for each object,
    which will work but might lead to more recompilations in jax. If you can, you should implement a custom :code:`__hash__`

    Example:

        The following example shows a class that implements a simple constraint checking that the total sum of the
        elements in the configuration is equal to a given value. The example shows how to implement the :code:`__call__` method
        and the :code:`__hash__` and :code:`__eq__` methods.

                # A simple constraint checking that the total sum of the elements
                # in the configuration is equal to a given value.

                # The value must be set as a pytree_node=False field, meaning
                # that it is a constant and changes to this value represent different
                # constraints.
                total_sum : float = struct.field(pytree_node=False)

                def __init__(self, total_sum):
                    self.total_sum = total_sum

                def __call__(self, x):
                    # Makes it jax-compatible
                    return jnp.sum(x, axis=-1) == self.total_sum

                def __hash__(self):
                    return hash(("SumConstraint", self.total_sum))

                def __eq__(self, other):
                    if isinstance(other, SumConstraint):
                        return self.total_sum == other.total_sum
                    return False

    Example:

        The following example shows how to implement the same function as above, but using a pure python function and
        a :func:`jax.pure_callback` to make it compatible with jax.
