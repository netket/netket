This module contains two classes used to index into hilbert spaces
inheriting from `HomogeneousHilbert`.

Those classes provide an informal API that can be used to extend or override
netket's indexing logic, which is particularly relevant when working with
constrained Hilbert spaces.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
    This is not part of NetKet's public API and may change at any moment!
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

An hilbert indexing class should respect the `HilbertIndex` protocol
defined in the file `base.py`.
