class ExchangeRule(MetropolisRule):
    r"""
    A Rule exchanging the state on a random couple of sites, chosen from a list of
    possible couples (clusters).

    This rule acts on two local degree of freedom :math:`s_i` and :math:`s_j`,
    and proposes a new state: :math:`s_1 \dots s^\prime_i \dots s^\prime_j \dots s_N`,
    where in general :math:`s^\prime_i \neq s_i` and :math:`s^\prime_j \neq s_j`.
    The sites :math:`i` and :math:`j` are also chosen to be within a maximum graph
    distance of :math:`d_{\mathrm{max}}`.

    The transition probability associated to this sampler can
    be decomposed into two steps:

    1. A pair of indices :math:`i,j = 1\dots N`, and such
       that :math:`\mathrm{dist}(i,j) \leq d_{\mathrm{max}}`,
       is chosen with uniform probability, excluding all the sites where
       :math:`s_i = s_j`;
    2. The sites are exchanged, i.e. :math:`s^\prime_i = s_j` and :math:`s^\prime_j = s_i`;

    Notice that this sampling method generates random permutations of the quantum
    numbers, thus global quantities such as the sum of the local quantum numbers
    are conserved during the sampling.
    This scheme should be used then only when sampling in a
    region where :math:`\sum_i s_i = \mathrm{constant}` is needed,
    otherwise the sampling would be strongly not ergodic.

    r"""2-Dimensional tensor :math:`T_{i,j}` of shape
    :math:`N_\text{clusters}\times 2` where the first dimension
    runs over the list of 2-site clusters and the second dimension
    runs over the 2 sites of those clusters.

    The Exchange rule will swap the two sites of a random row of this
    matrix at every Metropolis step.
