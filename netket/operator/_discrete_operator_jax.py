class DiscreteJaxOperator(DiscreteOperator):
    r"""Abstract base class for discrete operators that can
    be manipulated inside of jax function transformations.

    Any operator inheriting from this base class follows the
    :class:`netket.operator.DiscreteOperator` interface but
    can additionally be used inside of :func:`jax.jit`,
    :func:`jax.grad`, :func:`jax.vmap` or similar transformations.
    When passed to those functions, jax-compatible operators
    must not be passed as static arguments but as standard
    arguments, and they will not trigger recompilation if
    only the coefficients have changed.

    Some operators, such as :class:`netket.operator.Ising` or
    :class:`netket.operator.PauliStrings` can be converted to
    their jax-enabled counterparts by calling the method
    :meth:`~netket.operator.PauliStrings.to_jax_operator`.
    Not all operators support this conversion, but as
    :class:`netket.operator.PauliStrings` are flexible, if you
    can convert or write your hamiltonian as a sum of pauli
    strings you will be able to use
    :class:`netket.operator.PauliStringsJax`.


    .. note::

        Jax does not support dynamically varying shapes, so not
        all operators can be written as jax operators, and even
        if they could be written as such, they might generate
        more connected elements than their Numba counterpart.


    .. note::

        :class:`netket.operator.DiscreteJaxOperator` require a
        particular version of the hamiltonian sampling rule,
        :func:`netket.sampler.rules.HamiltonianRuleJax`, that is
        compatible with Jax.


    Defining custom discrete operators that are Jax-compatible
    ----------------------------------------------------------

    This class should be inherited by DiscreteOperators which
    wish to declare jax-compatibility.

    Classes inheriting from `DiscreteJaxOperator`` should be
    declared following a scheme like the following. Do notice
    in particular the declaration of the pytree flattening and
    unflattening, following the standard APIs of Jax discussed
    in the `Jax Pytree documentation <https://jax.readthedocs.io/en/latest/pytrees.html#custom-pytrees-and-initialization>`_.
