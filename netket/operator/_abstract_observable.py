    """Abstract class for quantum Observables.

    An observable is a general object that defines a quantity that
    can be comptued starting from a variational state. Observables
    should be computed using the method `expect` of the variational
    states, and derivatives of this expectation value can sometimes
    also be computed using the method `expect_and_grad`.

    All operators are Observables, but some observables are not
    operators (for example, the entanglement entropy observable
    does is not an operator).

    This class determines the basic methods that an observable
    must implement to work correctly with NetKet.
