        Constructs an Heisenberg operator given a hilbert space and a graph providing the
        connectivity of the lattice.

        Args:
            hilbert: Hilbert space the operator acts on.
            graph: The graph upon which this hamiltonian is defined.
            J: The strength of the coupling. Default is 1.
               Can pass a sequence of coupling strengths with coloured graphs:
               edges of colour n will have coupling strength J[n]
            sign_rule: If True, Marshal's sign rule will be used. On a bipartite
                lattice, this corresponds to a basis change flipping the Sz direction
                at every odd site of the lattice. For non-bipartite lattices, the
                sign rule cannot be applied. Defaults to True if the lattice is
                bipartite, False otherwise.
                If a sequence of coupling strengths is passed, defaults to False
                and a matching sequence of sign_rule must be specified to override it
            acting_on_subspace: Specifies the mapping between nodes of the graph and
                Hilbert space sites, so that graph node :code:`i ∈ [0, ..., graph.n_nodes - 1]`,
                corresponds to :code:`acting_on_subspace[i] ∈ [0, ..., hilbert.n_sites]`.
                Must be a list of length `graph.n_nodes`. Passing a single integer :code:`start`
                is equivalent to :code:`[start, ..., start + graph.n_nodes - 1]`.

        Examples:
         Constructs a ``Heisenberg`` operator for a 1D system.
