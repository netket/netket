        A graph-based quantum operator. In its simplest terms, this is the sum of
        local operators living on the edge of an arbitrary graph.

        A ``GraphOperator`` is constructed giving a hilbert space and either a
        list of operators acting on sites or a list acting on the bonds.
        Users can specify the color of the bond that an operator acts on, if
        desired. If none are specified, the bond operators act on all edges.

        Args:
         hilbert: Hilbert space the operator acts on.
         graph: The graph whose vertices and edges are considered to construct the
                operator
         site_ops: A list of operators in matrix form that act
                on the nodes of the graph.
                The default is an empty list. Note that if no site_ops are
                specified, the user must give a list of bond operators.
         bond_ops: A list of operators that act on the edges of the graph.
             The default is None. Note that if no bond_ops are
             specified, the user must give a list of site operators.
         bond_ops_colors: A list of edge colors, specifying the color each
             bond operator acts on. The default is an empty list.
         dtype: Data type type of the matrix elements.
         acting_on_subspace: Specifies the mapping between nodes of the graph and
            Hilbert space sites, so that graph node :code:`i ∈ [0, ..., graph.n_nodes]`,
            corresponds to :code:`acting_on_subspace[i] ∈ [0, ..., hilbert.n_sites]`.
            Must be a list of length `graph.n_nodes`. Passing a single integer :code:`start`
            is equivalent to :code:`[start, ..., start + graph.n_nodes - 1]`.

        Examples:
         Constructs a ``GraphOperator`` operator for a 2D system.
