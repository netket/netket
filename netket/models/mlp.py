class MLP(nn.Module):
    r"""A Multi-Layer Perceptron with hidden layers.

    This model uses the MLP block with output dimension 1, which is squeezed.

    This combines multiple dense layers and activations functions into a single object.
    It separates the output layer from the hidden layers,
    since it typically has a different form.
    One can specify the specific activation functions per layer.
    The size of the hidden dimensions can be provided as a number,
    or as a factor relative to the input size (similar as for RBM).
    The default model is a single linear layer without activations.

    Forms a common building block for models such as
    `PauliNet (continuous) <https://www.nature.com/articles/s41557-020-0544-y>`_
