        Constructs the ParticleExchange Rule.

        Particles are only exchanged between modes where the particle number is different.
        For fermions, only occupied orbitals can be exchanged with unoccupied ones.

        You can pass either a list of clusters or a netket graph object to
        determine the clusters to exchange.

        Args:
            hilbert: The hilbert space to be sampled.
            clusters: The list of clusters that can be exchanged. This should be
                a list of 2-tuples containing two integers. Every tuple is an edge,
                or cluster of sites to be exchanged.
            graph: A graph, from which the edges determine the clusters
                that can be exchanged.
            d_max: Only valid if a graph is passed in. The maximum distance
                between two sites
            exchange_spins: (default False) If exchange_spins, the graph must encode the
                connectivity  between the first N physical sites having same spin, and
                it is replicated using :func:`netket.graph.disjoint_union` other every
                spin subsector. This option conserves the number of fermions per
                spin subsector. If the graph does not have a number of sites equal
                to the number of orbitals in the hilbert space, this flag has no effect.
