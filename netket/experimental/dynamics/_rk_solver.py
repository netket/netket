        adaptive: Whether to use adaptive timestepping (Defaults to False).
            Not all integrators support adaptive timestepping.
        atol: Maximum absolute error at every time-step during adaptive timestepping.
            A larger value will lead to larger timestep. This option is ignored if
            `adaptive=False`. A value of 0 means it is ignored. Note that the `norm` used
            to compute the error can be  changed in the :ref:`netket.experimental.TDVP`
            driver. (Defaults to 0).

            changed in the :ref:`netket.experimental.TDVP` driver. (Defaults to 1e-7)
        dt_limits: A length-2 tuple of minimum and maximum timesteps considered by
            adaptive time-stepping. A value of None signals that there is no bound.
            Defaults to :code:`(None, 10*dt)`.
