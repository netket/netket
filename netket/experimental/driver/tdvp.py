    Variational time evolution based on the time-dependent variational principle which,
    when used with Monte Carlo sampling via :class:`netket.vqs.MCState`, is the time-dependent VMC
    (t-VMC) method.

    .. note::
        This TDVP Driver uses the time-integrators from the `nkx.dynamics` module, which are
        automatically executed under a `jax.jit` context.

        When running computations on GPU, this can lead to infinite hangs or extremely long
        compilation times. In those cases, you might try setting the configuration variable
        `nk.config.netket_experimental_disable_ode_jit = True` to mitigate those issues.

        Initializes the time evolution driver.

        Args:
            operator: The generator of the dynamics (Hamiltonian for pure states,
                Lindbladian for density operators).
            variational_state: The variational state.
            integrator: Configuration of the algorithm used for solving the ODE.
            t0: Initial time at the start of the time evolution.
            propagation_type: Determines the equation of motion: "real"  for the
                real-time SchrÃ¶dinger equation (SE), "imag" for the imaginary-time SE.
            qgt: The QGT specification.
            linear_solver: The solver for solving the linear system determining the time evolution.
                This must be a jax-jittable function :code:`f(A,b) -> x` that accepts a Matrix-like, Linear Operator
                PyTree object :math:`A` and a vector-like PyTree :math:`b` and returns the PyTree :math:`x` solving
                the system :math:`Ax=b`.
                Defaults to :func:`nk.optimizer.solver.svd` with the default svd threshold of 1e-10.
                To change the svd threshold you can use :func:`functools.partial` as follows:
                :code:`functools.partial(nk.optimizer.solver.svd, rcond=1e-4)`.
            linear_solver_restart: If False (default), the last solution of the linear system
                is used as initial value in subsequent steps.
            error_norm: Norm function used to calculate the error with adaptive integrators.
                Can be either "euclidean" for the standard L2 vector norm :math:`w^\dagger w`,
                "maximum" for the maximum norm :math:`\max_i |w_i|`
                or "qgt", in which case the scalar product induced by the QGT :math:`S` is used
                to compute the norm :math:`\Vert w \Vert^2_S = w^\dagger S w` as suggested
                in PRL 125, 100503 (2020).
                Additionally, it possible to pass a custom function with signature
                :code:`norm(x: PyTree) -> float`
                which maps a PyTree of parameters :code:`x` to the corresponding norm.
                Note that norm is used in jax.jit-compiled code.
