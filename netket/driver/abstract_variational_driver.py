# Note: to implement a new Driver (see also _vmc.py for an example)
# If you want to inherit the nice interface of AbstractMCDriver, you should
# subclass it, defining the following methods:
# - Either _forward_and_backward or individually _forward, _backward, that should
#   compute the loss function and the gradient. If the driver is minimizing or
#   maximising some loss function, this quantity should be assigned to self._stats
#   in order to monitor it.
# - _estimate_stats should return the MC estimate of a single operator
# - reset should reset the driver (usually the sampler).
# - info should return a string with an overview of the driver.
# - The __init__ method shouldbe called with the machine and the optimizer. If this
#   driver is minimising a loss function and you want it's name to show up automatically
#   in the progress bar/ouput files you should pass the optional keyword argument
#   minimized_quantity_name.
