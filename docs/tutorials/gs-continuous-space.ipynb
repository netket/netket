To do this, NetKet provides the so-called Metropolis-Hasting sampler. This sampler uses an initial state in the Hilbert space (e.g. a random state) and produces a new state according to a transtition rule. The new state is accepted (e.g. becomes the initial state for another update according to the transition rule) if its probability is high enough (the probability of the state is determined by the variational Ansatz, see later). While you can write your own transition rule, NetKet already implements a common transition rule, that often is sufficient to run a VMC optimization.\n",
