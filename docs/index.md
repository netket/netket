NetKet: The Machine Learning Toolbox for Quantum Physics
===========================================

NetKet is a Python library for using machine learning methods to study many-body quantum systems. It provides efficient and flexible building blocks for writing novel algorithms as well as simple, easy-to-use implementations of established algorithms.

NetKet is built on top of [JAX](https://jax.readthedocs.io), a framework for differentiable programming that works on CPUs, GPUs and TPUs. Neural Network architectures can be specified using any JAX-based framework such as [Flax](https://flax.readthedocs.io).
