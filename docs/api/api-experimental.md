# Experimental API

```{eval-rst}
.. currentmodule:: netket.experimental
```

In this page we present some experimental interfaces of NetKet.
Those are not guaranteed to be API-stable, and might change without notice (other than the
changelog) among minor releases.
The [netket.experimental](api-experimental) module mirrors the standard {ref}`netket <netket_api>` module structure,
and we suggest to use it as follows:

```python
import netket as nk
import netket.experimental as nkx
```

(experimental-drivers-api)=
## Drivers
Currently NetKet offers an experimental driver implementing Stochastic Reconfiguration with the [kernel trick](https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.05715) 
(originally introduced under the name of [minSR by Ao Chen and Markus Heyl](https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.01941)). This is slightly more limited in
features than the standard Stochastic Reconfiguration implementation of {class}`netket.drivers.VMC`, but can scale to millions of parameters

```{eval-rst}
.. autosummary::
   :toctree: _generated/experimental/driver
   :template: class
   :nosignatures:

   driver.VMC_SRt
```


(experimental-qsr-api)=
## Quantum State Reconstruction
The Quantum State Reconstruction algorithm performs an approximate tomographic reconstruction of measurement data coming from a quantum computer (or similar device) using a Pure or Mixed quantum state.

```{eval-rst}
.. autosummary::
   :toctree: _generated/experimental/qsr
   :template: class
   :nosignatures:

   QSR
```

(experimental-sampler-api)=
## Samplers

They are experimental, meaning that we could change them at some point, and we actively seeking for feedback and opinions on their usage and APIs.

```{eval-rst}
.. currentmodule:: netket.experimental

```

### Parallel tempering samplers

An experimental sampler is MetropolisSamplerPmap, which makes use of {func}`jax.pmap`
to use different GPUs/CPUs without having to use MPI. It should scale much better over
several CPUs, but you have to start jax with a specific environment variable.


```{eval-rst}
.. autosummary::
   :toctree: _generated/samplers
   :template: class
   :nosignatures:

   sampler.MetropolisSamplerPmap
```

### Particle-specific samplers

The following samplers are for 2nd-quantisation fermionic hilbert spaces ({class}`netket.experimental.hilbert.SpinOrbitalFermions`).

```{eval-rst}
.. autosummary::
   :toctree: _generated/samplers
   :template: flax_module_or_default
   :nosignatures:


   sampler.MetropolisParticleExchange
```

And the corresponding rules
```{eval-rst}
.. autosummary::
   :toctree: _generated/samplers
   :template: flax_module_or_default
   :nosignatures:


   sampler.rules.ParticleExchangeRule
```

(experimental-logging-api)=
## Logging

```{eval-rst}
.. currentmodule:: netket.experimental

```

This module contains experimental loggers that can be used with the optimization drivers.


```{eval-rst}
.. autosummary::
   :toctree: _generated/experimental/logging
   :nosignatures:

   logging.HDF5Log

```

(experimental-variational-api)=
## Variational State Interface

```{eval-rst}
.. currentmodule:: netket.experimental
```

```{eval-rst}
.. autosummary::
  :toctree: _generated/experimental/variational
  :nosignatures:

  vqs.variables_from_file
  vqs.variables_from_tar

```

## Time Evolution Driver


```{eval-rst}
.. currentmodule:: netket.experimental
```

```{eval-rst}
.. autosummary::
  :toctree: _generated/experimental/dynamics
  :nosignatures:

  TDVP
  driver.TDVPSchmitt
```

## ODE Integrators

### Concrete solvers
This is a collection of ODE solvers that can be used with the TDVP driver above.

```{eval-rst}
.. currentmodule:: netket.experimental
```

```{eval-rst}
.. autosummary::
   :toctree: _generated/experimental/dynamics
   :nosignatures:

   dynamics.Euler
   dynamics.Heun
   dynamics.Midpoint
   dynamics.RK12
   dynamics.RK23
   dynamics.RK4
   dynamics.RK45
```
The corresponding integrator is then automatically constructed within the TDVP driver. 


### Abstract classes 
Those are the abstract classes you can inherit from to implement your own solver
```{eval-rst}
.. currentmodule:: netket.experimental
```

```{eval-rst}
.. autosummary::
   :toctree: _generated/experimental/dynamics
   :template: class
   :nosignatures:

   dynamics.AbstractSolver
   dynamics.AbstractSolverState
```


## Fermions

This modules contains hilbert space and operator implementations of fermions in second quantization.
It is experimental until it has been thoroughly tested by the community, meaning feedback is welcome.

```{eval-rst}
.. currentmodule:: netket.experimental
```

```{eval-rst}
.. autosummary::
   :toctree: _generated/hilbert
   :template: class
   :nosignatures:

   hilbert.SpinOrbitalFermions
```

```{eval-rst}
.. autosummary::
   :toctree: _generated/operator
   :template: class
   :nosignatures:

   operator.FermionOperator2nd
   operator.fermion.create
   operator.fermion.destroy
   operator.fermion.number
   operator.from_pyscf_molecule
   operator.pyscf.TV_from_pyscf_molecule
```

## Observables
This module contains various observables that can be computed starting from various variational states.

```{eval-rst}
.. autosummary::
   :toctree: _generated/experimental/observable
   :template: class
   :nosignatures:

   observable.Renyi2EntanglementEntropy
   observable.VarianceObservable
```
