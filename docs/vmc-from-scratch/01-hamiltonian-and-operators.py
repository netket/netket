# # Part 1: Hamiltonians and Operators
#
# The goal of this tutorial series is to guide you through writing a simple VMC code from (almost) scratch to compute the ground-state of a paradigmatic spin model: the transverse-field Ising model in 2 dimensions.
#
# In this first tutorial, we will focus on:
# - Understanding NetKet's graph and operator system
# - Defining Hamiltonians using building blocks
# - Working with different operator formats
# - Validating our implementation with exact diagonalization
#
# The hamiltonian we will study is the transverse-field Ising model in 2 dimensions:
#
# $$
# \mathcal{H}=-h\sum_{i}\sigma_{i}^{(x)}+J\sum_{\langle i,j \rangle}\sigma_{i}^{(z)}\sigma_{j}^{(z)}.
# $$
#
# In the following we assume periodic boundary conditions with $h=1$ and $J=1$.

# ## 1. What is NetKet?
#
# [NetKet](http://www.netket.org) is a comprehensive package developed to perform Variational Monte Carlo calculations, while hiding varying degrees of complexity from researchers who don't want to get their hands too dirty with nitty gritty details.
#
# NetKet is thoroughly documented in [its publication](https://scipost.org/SciPostPhysCodeb.7/pdf) and partly in its [online documentation](https://netket.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html). When in doubt, check those, and if you find no answer, ask on our official [discussion forum](https://github.com/orgs/netket/discussions).

# ## 2. Defining Graphs and Lattices
#
# NetKet covers quite a few standard lattices, so let's use this to quickly define a 2D square lattice with periodic boundary conditions.
# For the moment we assume $L=4$ ($N=16$ sites total).

# %%
# Define a 2D square lattice
L = 4
g = nk.graph.Hypercube(length=L, n_dim=2, pbc=True)

# %% [markdown]
# The graph object is handy to quickly write the hamiltonian because it gives you easy access to the vertices (called nodes) and edges of the graph:

# %%
# The number of sites (called nodes):
print("g.n_nodes:", g.n_nodes)
# You can iterate through the nodes:
print("g.nodes:", [node for node in g.nodes()])
# You can check the number of edges:
print("g.n_edges:", g.n_edges)
# You can iterate through the edges, which are stored as a 2-tuple with the start and end node:
print("g.edges:", list(g.edges()))

# %% [markdown]
# You can also visualize the lattice:

# %%
g.draw()

# %% [markdown]
# ## 3. Defining the Hilbert Space
#
# Next, NetKet asks us to define the computational space (or basis) for this calculation.

# %%
# Define the Hilbert space based on this graph
# We have spin-1/2 particles on each site
hi = nk.hilbert.Spin(s=1 / 2, N=g.n_nodes)

# %% [markdown]
# This is a fundamental object that defines how many degrees of freedom you have and how you store configurations. In this case, the hilbert space stores them as local variables +1 or -1.

# %% [markdown]
# ## 4. Building Operators
#
# In NetKet you can build individual operators acting on a site by calling the following functions:

# %%
sx_1 = nk.operator.spin.sigmax(hi, 1)
sy_2 = nk.operator.spin.sigmay(hi, 2)
sz_2 = nk.operator.spin.sigmaz(hi, 2)

# %% [markdown]
# The functions in `nk.operator.spin` and `nk.operator.boson` are used to create the fundamental operators that can be used to build arbitrary observables and Hamiltonians.
# Those functions return an object of type [LocalOperator](https://netket.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api/_generated/operator/netket.operator.LocalOperator.html#netket.operator.LocalOperator), which behaves as some sort of sparse matrix optimized for Variational Monte Carlo.
#
# :::{note}
# A `LocalOperator` can efficiently represent only operators that have a small domain in the computational basis: this means that an operator acting on 1 or 2 qubits will be efficiently represented, but one that acts on many qubits at once will not be.
# :::
#
# A LocalOperator can be printed and has the following representation:

# %%
print(sx_1)

# %% [markdown]
# The information tells you that:
#  * `dim`: The hilbert space has 16 local degrees of freedom
#  * `acting_on`: this specific operator is composed by terms that act on the single site 1
#  * `constant`: this is a diagonal shift proportional to the identity. In this case it is 0
#  * `dtype`: the numpy data-type of the matrix elements

# %% [markdown]
# ## 5. Exercise: Building the Transverse Field Ising Hamiltonian
#
# You can combine operators by multiplying, adding or subtracting them. Let's build the Transverse field Ising hamiltonian:
#
# $$
# \mathcal{H}=-h\sum_{i}\sigma_{i}^{(x)}+J\sum_{\langle i,j \rangle}\sigma_{i}^{(z)}\sigma_{j}^{(z)}.
# $$
#
# where $h=1$ and $J=1$.
#
# Try to convert the equation above to code, using the operators that were discussed before (`nk.operator.spin.sigmax` and `nk.operator.spin.sigmaz`).
#
# Complete the code below:
#

# %% [markdown]
#
# %% tags=["placeholder", "hide-input", "hide-output"]
# This creates an empty operator (or zero) to which you can add others.
# hamiltonian = nk.operator.LocalOperator(hi)
#
# now add all terms acting on single sites
# for site in g.nodes():  # every node (take the list of nodes from the graph object g)
#     # TODO: Add the transverse field term -h * sigma_x
#     pass
#
# now add all terms acting on multiple sites
# for i, j in g.edges():  # every edge (take the list of edges from the graph object)
#     # TODO: Add the Ising interaction term J * sigma_z_i * sigma_z_j
#     pass


# %% tags=["solution"]
# This creates an empty operator to which you can add others.
hamiltonian = nk.operator.LocalOperator(hi)

# the list of nodes is given by g.nodes()
for site in g.nodes():
    hamiltonian = hamiltonian - 1.0 * nk.operator.spin.sigmax(hi, site)

for (i,j) in g.edges():
    # you can multiply operators by using the @ operator
    hamiltonian = hamiltonian + nk.operator.spin.sigmaz(hi, i)@nk.operator.spin.sigmaz(hi, j)

# %% [markdown]
# To check if your implementation is correct, you can run the following validation.
# It will error if your implementation is wrong.

# %%
# Validation - test to verify your code is correct
hamiltonian_correct = nk.operator.Ising(hi, g, h=1.0, J=1.0)
assert np.sum(np.abs(hamiltonian_correct.to_sparse() - hamiltonian.to_sparse())**2) < 1e-5
print("Hamiltonian implementation is correct!")

# %% [markdown]
# ## 6. Converting Operator Formats
#
# Most operators in NetKet are implemented in Numba and are not compatible with `jax.jit`. However, some particular operator formats are implemented both in `numba` and in a `jax.jit`-compatible format.
#
# To make future tutorials easier, we will convert the operator to a JAX-friendly format. First we convert from the `LocalOperator` format to the `PauliStrings` format, then to the jax format:

# %%
hamiltonian_jax = hamiltonian.to_pauli_strings().to_jax_operator()

# %% [markdown]
# ## 7. Exact Diagonalization (Validation)
#
# As a matter of comparison for future tutorials, let's compute the exact ground-state energy using scipy's sparse eigensolver.
#
# You can convert your operator to a sparse matrix with the method `.to_sparse()`. Use scipy to diagonalize it and extract the lowest eigenvalue.

# %% tags=["placeholder", "hide-input", "hide-output"]
# TODO: Import scipy.sparse.linalg.eigsh and use it to find the ground state
# from scipy.sparse.linalg import eigsh

# Compute the exact ground state energy and wavefunction
# e_gs, psi_gs = ...

# %% tags=["solution"]
# use scipy.sparse.linalg.eigsh instead of numpy.linalg.eigh because
# the sparse version is much faster as it uses sparsity!
from scipy.sparse.linalg import eigsh

# k=1 to only get one eigenvalue
e_gs, psi_gs = eigsh(hamiltonian.to_sparse(), k=1)
# get ground state energy and
e_gs = e_gs[0]
# ground state
psi_gs = psi_gs.reshape(-1)

# %% [markdown]
# ## 8. Validation Test
#
# If you implemented everything correctly, this validation should pass:

# %%
assert e_gs.shape == ()
assert psi_gs.shape == (hi.n_states, )
assert -34.01060 < e_gs < -34.01059
print(f"Exact ground state energy: {e_gs:.6f}")

# %% [markdown]
# In the next tutorial, we will use these tools to implement variational ansÃ¤tze and compute energies using full summation over the Hilbert space.
