      Sustain NetKet's developers

NetKet
------

If you find the NetKet project useful for your research, please consider citing our relevant software papers
in order to help us to continue devoting time and ressources to NetKet development.

The current version of NetKet 3.x is described in our recent preprint `arXiv:2112.10526 <https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.10526>`_.

NetKet 2.x is described in `SoftwareX 10, 100311 (2019) <https://doi.org/10.1016/j.softx.2019.100311>`_.
Despite many new features, NetKet 3 still builds on the foundations of the NetKet 2 era too. Therefore,
we would appreciate it if you cite both papers in order to continue giving credit to all the authors of
NetKet 2 as well.

Below are BibTeX entries for both papers:
