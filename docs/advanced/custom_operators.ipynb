    "The first function here is very similar to the `e_loc` we defined in the previous section, however instead of taking `eta` and `mels` as two different arguments, they are passed as a tuple named `extra_args`, and must be unpacked by the kernel.\n",
    "That's because every operator has it's own `get_local_kernel_arguments` which prepares those extra_args, and every different operator might be passing different objects to the kernel.\n",
    "\n",
    "Also do note that the kernel is jit-compiled, therefore it must make use of `jax.numpy` functions, while the `get_local_kernel_argument` function *is not jitted*, and it is executed before jitting.\n",
    "This is in order to allow extra flexibility: sometimes your operators need some pre-processing code that is not jax-jittable, but is only numba-jittable, for example (this is the case of most operators in NetKet). \n",
    "\n",
    "All operators and super-operators in netket define those two methods. \n",
    "If you want to see some examples of how it is used internally, look at the source code found in [this folder](https://github.com/netket/netket/blob/master/netket/vqs/mc/MCState/expect.py).\n",
    "An additional benefit of using this latter definition, is that is automatically enables `expect_and_grad` for your custom operator.\n",

    "## Comparison of the two approaches\n",
    "\n",
    "Above you've seen two different ways to define `expect`, but it might be unclear which one you should use in your code.\n",
    "In general, you should prefer the second one: the _simple_ interface is easier to use and enables by default gradients too.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you can express the expectation value of your operator in such a way that it can be estimated by simply averaging a single local-estimator the simple interface is best. \n",
    "We expect that you should be able to use this interface in the vast majority of cases. \n",
    "However in some cases you might want to try something particular, experiment, or your operator cannot be expressed in this form, or you want to try out some optimisations (such as chunking), or compute many operators at once.\n",
    "That's why we also allow you to override the general `expect` method alltogether: it allows a lot of extra flexibility."
